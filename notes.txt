Case study goals: 
	-Health has hired you to uncover insights on potential
	hospital efficiency opportunities.
	-Leverage TAbleau to create an engaging dashboard


6 Framework for healthcare quality
Safety- Avoiding harm to patients from the care that is intended to help them.
Effectiveness - How well a healthcare service achieve its intended purpose.
Timeliness - Reducing delays for both those who receive and those who give care.
Patient-Centered - Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values.
Equity - Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics.
Efficiency - Avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy.

-We will focus on Efficiency

important indicator of efficiency
-Length of stay (LOS) - the duration in days for a patient stay in hospital

-Reducing LOS can lower costs, increase capacity, and improve throughput.
-Factors impacting LOS: patient age, health status, procedure, complications, mortality, risk, hospital size, etc.

the focus of study is Patient population for analysis
	Hip replacement surgery

-Patients with hip pain may require elective hip replacement surgery
-Damaged bone and cartilage is removed and replaced with prosthetic components
-Arrival to hospitals with surgery on day zero, stay 0-2days


The dataset
-NY state-wide hospitals discharge data for 2016 (anonymous)
-Elective hip replacement surgery patients
-One single table with 30 columns
-Each row represents a single inpatient stay from admission to discharge



Insights
1. Unsurprisingly NYC has the highest number of hospitals which as 29.14% across Health Service Area
2. Among top 15 hospitals by discharge volume the longest avg LOS is 3.22 days
with Surgeons working on Syosset Hospital, while the highest overall cost per discharge was NYU Lutheran Medical Center which has $86k and 2.6days LOS.
3. A higher number of surgeons per patient doesn't mean higher LOS and costs.
4. On average, patient illness with an Extreme severity resulted in much higher LOS and costs.
